*** { @unit = "", @title = "The R Toolkit", @reading, @lecture, @foldout }

## Introducing R

R is a 30-year-old statistical language created by New Zealand statisticians Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka as a free alternative to proprietary software for their students at the University of Auckland. In fact, its rich lineage can be directly traced to inventor and scientist Alexander Graham Bell.

Watch the video below for a brief introduction to R as it's used today.

<br>

## The R Toolkit

In this course we cover the foundations of data programming with the R language. In order to create robust and dynamic analysis we need to use a couple of tools that were built to leverage the power of R and create compelling narratives.

**RStudio** helps you manage projects by organizing files, scripts, packages and output. **Markdown** is a simple formatting convention that allows you to create publication-quality documents. **R Markdown** is a specific version of Markdown that allows you to combine text and code to create data-driven documents.

The following resources will help you get a better understanding of these tools.

* [Chapter 1: Core R](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-010-core-r.html): Learning the basics of R

* [Chapter 2: RStudio](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-020-rstudio.html): RStudio's functionality and features

* [Data-Driven Docs](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-030-data-driven-docs.html): How R Markdown is used for interactive and dynamic reports

* [A Guide to Markdown](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/ch-031-markdown.html): How to use Markdown - the easy-to-learn formatting syntax

<br>

## Visualizing Tooling

Each tool you'll use in this course has a corresponding image, summarized below.

<br>

## Understand Your Resources

Data analytics is a very social endeavor and real-world analytics projects are almost always collaborative.

These courses are designed to be interactive, and a lot of learning occurs by practicing the technical jargon from the field and learning how to talk about data and models.

Learning how to seek help and use discussion boards will accelerate learning and facilitate collaboration. Social coding tools like GitHub use these features extensively.

We are going to throw a lot at you, but also provide a lot of support. Over these first couple of weeks feel free to reach out for anything you might need.

<br>

### Troubleshooting & Clarification

If you find something confusing, let us know (likely others will find it confusing as well).

* Schedule a Zoom call with your instructor and screen share to walk through issues
* Post a question to the [course discussion board](https://lalmada1.github.io/Intro-to-Data-Science-Econ-4970/help/)
* Request a walk-through and your instructor will provide examples and steps

As a general rule of thumb, if you are stuck on the math or code for a problem, need clarification about what the question is asking, want to make sure you understand a formula, or are having similar issues then the help discussion page is the easiest and quickest way to get help. If you are confused about concepts or having a hard time even formulating your question, then office hours are your best option.

<br>

![](https://i.imgur.com/FNGjWce.png)

Adapted from **[SRGRAFO](https://www.srgrafo.com/)**.

<br>

### The Benefits of GitHub Issues

Note that the discussion board is hosted by the GitHub issues feature. It is a great forum because:

* You can format code and math using standard markdown syntax
* You can cut and paste images directly into the message
* You can direction responses using @username mentions

Please preview your responses before posting to ensure proper formatting. Note that you format code by placing fences around the code:

````
```
# your code here
lm( y ~ x1 + x2 )
```
````

The fences are made of three back-ticks. These look like quotation marks, but are actually the character at the top left of your keyboard (if you have a US or European keyboard) and shared with the *tilde* (`~`).

````
```
y = b0 + b1•X1 + b2•X2 + e

b1 = cov(x,y) / var(x)
```
````

** Unit 1 - Functions and Vectors

*** { @unit = "", @title = "Unit Overview", @reading, @foldout  }

## Description

This unit introduces the most fundamental building blocks of data programming in R.

* **Vectors** are one or more values of the same type - each column in a table is a vector
* **Functions** are defined operations that transform individual or summarize multiple values
* **Objects** are named representations of values, datasets, functions, and other information
* **Assignment** is the act of naming and creating an object

## Learning Objectives

Once you have completed this unit, you will be able to:

1. Create new objects with assignment
2. Understand the basic anatomy and application of functions
3. Summarize vectors of various classes e.g. numeric, character, and logical

## Lab Assignment

Lab-01 is your first opportunity to combine human language and R code in R Markdown. You will practice using tax parcel data from Syracuse, NY (USA), including:

* Summarizing dataset characteristics, e.g. dimensions
* Use arithmetic functions to summarize and average data
* Determine the number of occurrences of qualitative data

### Functions

This assignment requires some combination of the following functions and operators:

* `names()`: Returns the variable names of a dataset
* `head()`: Returns the initial values of a dataset; default is 6 rows
* `$`: Extracts a variable from a dataset using `data$variable` syntax
* `length()`: Returnes the total number of values in a vector
* `dim()`: Returns the total rows and columns of a dataset, respectively
* `nrow()`: Returns the total rows of a dataset
* `ncol()`: Returns the total columns of a dataset
* `sum()`: Returns the sum of:
    - All values in a numeric vector
    - Total `TRUE` values of a logical vector
* `summary()`: Returns summary statistics for a dataset or individual vectors
* `table()`: Returns a tally of the number of occurrences of unique values in a vector

### Practice Data

This assignment uses Downtown Syracuse tax parcel data. View the documentation **[here](../labs/syr_parcels.html)**.

These data are imported using the following code.

```r
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4PS/Data-Science-Class/master/DATA/syr_parcels.csv"
dat <- read.csv(url, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(dat)
```

#### Downtown Syracuse

View the portion of Syracuse represented by these data.

# Beginning

*Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, and I really wish somebody had told this to me.*

*All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But it's like there is this gap. For the first couple years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good. It’s not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.*

*But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you. A lot of people never get past that phase. They quit.*

*Everybody I know who does interesting, creative work they went through years where they had really good taste and they could tell that what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. They knew it fell short. Everybody goes through that.*

*And if you are just starting out or if you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap. And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.*

*I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It takes awhile. It’s gonna take you a while. It’s normal to take a while. You just have to fight your way through that.*

*—Ira Glass [on failure](https://jamesclear.com/ira-glass-failure)*

---

*It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.*

## Lab-02 - Constructing Groups

Read the following sections from the [course chapter on groups](http://ds4ps.org/dp4ss-textbook/p-050-business-logic.html) before starting the lab.

You will need a basic understanding of constructing groups and subsets in these sections.

* Logical Operators (1.1)
* Selector Vectors (1.2)
* Usefulness of Selector Vectors (1.3)
* Compound Logical Statements (2.1)  
* The Opposite-Of Operator (2.2)  

The rest of the chapter is useful information to come back to, but not needed for the lab.

*Similar to last week, the chapter highlights some easy ways to make errors with your code. We don't want to convince you that R is hard, but rather to ensure that you are paying attention to some subtle features of machine language that can impact your data.*

### Advice on Learning R

> People naturally go through a few phases. When you start out, you don’t have many tips and techniques at your disposal. So, you are forced to do the simplest thing possible using the simplest ideas. And sometimes you face problems that are really hard to solve, because you don’t know quite the right techniques yet. So, the very earliest phase, you’ve got a few techniques that you understand really well, and you apply them everywhere because those are the techniques you know.
>
> And the next stage that a lot of people go through, is that you learn more techniques, and more complex ways of solving problems, and then you get excited about them and start to apply them everywhere possible. So instead of using the simplest possible solution, you end up creating something that’s probably overly complex or uses some overly general formulation.
>
> And then eventually you get past that and it’s about understanding, “what are the techniques at my disposal? Which techniques fit this problem most naturally? How can I express myself as clearly as possible, so I can understand what I am doing, and so other people can understand what I am doing?” I talk about this a lot but think explicitly about code as communication. You are obviously telling the computer what to do, but ideally you want to write code to express what it means or what it is trying to do as well, so when others read it and when you in the future reads it, you can understand some of the reasoning.

## Create a Data Dashboard in R

Working with the crash data from Lab-05, you will extend the work you began in Lab-04 by building on a dynamic data dashboard that will be used to explore and reveal insights in Tempe crash data.

<a class="uk-button uk-button-default" onclick="window.open('../units/07-dashboards/lab-07-instructions.html')">Final Project Instructions</a>

The following link downloads two templates:

* The entire dashboard, including all tabs
* A one-tab dashboard with helpful hints

We recommended creating new tabs independently, then incorporating them into the final dashboard.
